///STEP ONE///
Requirement: Detect all valid IPs in a range

Make a file that ingests a file then starts scanning a list of subnets

Subnet_sweep.py:
	Load a file (csv) of IPs and prefix lengths
	Get a value like 192.168.1.1, 24 which means we need to scan .1->.255
	So CIDR pow(2, 32) 2**(32-32) == 2**0 == 1 
			   2**(32-24) == 2**8 == 256
	Breakup CIDR based on subnet mask [32-24] (.X) | [23-16] (.X.X) | [15-8] (.X.X.X) | [7-0] (X.X.X.X)
	Will initially focus on the >=24 PL case.
	So we get 192.168.1.0/24 which means we do 192.168.1.0 + [i] where i iterates to 255
	
	Subnet sweep should/does return a list of endpoints in a list:
		How should we format this output? This return would be a list where I have the first subnet detected endpoints
		That'd be the first index, the next index would be the next list and so forth. but why
		Why would you return a list of list becuase the endproduct of your endpoints is that you
			take the endpoints that you've discovered in the network then populate the graph
			and chart relations between endpoints so really we just need *initially* a list of 
			all endpoints then need.
		
		SO subnet sweeper outputs a list of discovered endpoints, now we need to intercept that traffic and create relations
